# Org-Mode Architectual Decision Records

Architectual decision records are documents that capture the context, alternatives to, reasoning behind, and thought process involved in making a decision that effects the structure (or architecture) of a project. ADRs maintain an important historical record of the thought process behind an impactful decision.

As the title declares, this ADR pertains to decisions involved in the structure and configuration of a personal org-mode instance, and helps to record the history behind making impactful decisions for that system.
