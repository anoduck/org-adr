# 9. Use files to categorize

Date: 01/02/2026 14:34

## Status

ACCEPTED

## Context

This ADR concerns how information is organized within the ORG system. Specifically, how that information is provided
with and associated to context. This is done through categorization.

## Decision

By categorizing information we assign it a contextual association, thus it makes sense to manage org information on a
category per file basis. This helps maintain and prioritize contextual association, and prevents interference generated
from informational type.

## Consequences

Since we have always managed our org system through categorized files, there is little to change.
