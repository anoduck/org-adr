# 8. Org Inbox File

Date: 02/08/2025 14:59

## Status

ACCEPTED

## Context

* Task Processing
* Task Organization
* Refiling Tasks
* Org Workspace

## Decision

In side the Org task management system there should be a file named `inbox.org`. This file will be used only
temporarily, to place tasks and projects which need to be refiled into other org files at a later place in
time. It's use will be to provide a "scratchpad" to place items before formalization. 

## Consequences

It's benefit will be to speed up the process of inputing tasks into the system, and will provide time to
better structure ideas and thought at a later point in time.
