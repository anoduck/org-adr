# 1. Use Nygaard Template

Date: 25/04/2025 18:34

## Status

ACCEPTED

## Context

MADR was first choice, but when it came to creation, the length and deptch of the format was too much. If kept without
change, it would have remained burdensome, and then dropped altogether. The Nygaard is much much simpler.

## Decision

Sticking with Nygaard to keep things simple.

## Consequences

Restart ADR repository all over again, and the selection of tooling to use.
